From 2010 to 2012, Walmart attained a monthly sales average of **600 million**. Stores classified as *Type A*, which is **64%** of them, contribute the most sales, averaging **20,000** sales per store. Walmart performs much better during the hotter seasons, spring and summer, compared to the colder seasons, autumn and winter. Holidays, such as Christmas, are days that contribute to a large number of sales, with the corresponding week contributing around 10% to 20% of a given month's sales. January and November have performed the worst with sales numbers contributing only 5% and 6% respectively of sales overall.

# Insights Deep Dive
## **Seasonality Time Series Analysis**  
- **Monthly Time Series Analysis:** Walmart experiences a high jump in sales from January, which is at its lowest at around **325 million**, to February, increasing by around **300 million**. Walmart's sales then undergo steady gains till April, where it experiences its first peak. Following April, Walmart experiences a small dip in sales before steadily increasing till it reaches its second and highest peak in July. After that, the remaining months float above **550 million** sales, except for November at around **400 million** sales.
- **Seasonal Analysis:** It is clear that Walmart does much better during the warmer seasons than the colder seasons. In the colder seasons, Walmart procured **3.1 billion** sales across the three years and in the warmer seasons, Walmart has procured **3.7 billion** sales over three years. This suggests that people buy more items in the hotter climates than the colder climates, possibly due to summer holidays.
